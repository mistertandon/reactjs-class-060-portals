 - Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
- This is particularly useful when you need to display content that visually "breaks out" of its container or when dealing with components like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns that need to be rendered on top of other elements in the page.
